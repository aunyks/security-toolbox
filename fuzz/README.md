# Fuzz(ers)
Here are some fuzzers. Some of them do recon, and some of them do exploitation. But, they're all fuzzers nonetheless.  

Fuzzers try putting random or structured information into a target in order to observe some unexpected behavior in hopes that the target will expose some weakeness or vulnerability that can be capitalized upon.
