# My Security Toolbox
These are scripts, wordlists, and other files that I use to do my security research. Please feel free to ask questions if you have any regarding how to use these tools on a *consenting* target.  

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and NPM to run almost all of these scripts.
